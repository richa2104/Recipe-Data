Good morning all,I am Richa Yadav, 
I have overall IT experience is 4.2 years.
currently working at LG Soft India in Mobile Product Solutions as a DevOps Engineer.
Our main aim is to prepare a stable software/binary for LG mobile.

So for achieving our task we use Git version control and source management system along with gerrit review system.
the CI/CD tool used by us is Jenkins, We are using containerization tool docker and configuration too ansible as well.
Apart from that we use shell scripting as well.

Let me explain you in brief how we acheive the same.

Our process starts by getting new model request.
We have master branch by following the branching strategy we branch out.

And as you know we have mutliple functionalities in mobile software, so the respective team will commit their changes in branch.
For delivering the changes/commit, we use git version control system along with gerrit review system.
Each commit msg have specific format and is reviewed by team leader before merging in branch.
Once we are ready with all the changes branch, we proceed with the build.

we uses Jenkins CI/CD tool for building our software.
In Jenkins, a new job is created for that specific model and is configured with necessary details and build commads, post build actions.
After building, we finally deploy our software to a Network Attached Storage.

Once our software is prepared we do Flash it in mobiles and try to verify changes done by us.

In scenarios handsets are not availabe that time docker containerization tool came into picture.
dockerfiles were written with the all the dependancies, configuration and software details. and the unavialabitily of handset was overcome by accessing the emulator by running a docker conatiner.
Android Emulator simulates Android devices on your computer.
We have been using Ansible as well for configuring the build servers, as each model's build requirement varies. 

That is all about my current project.
